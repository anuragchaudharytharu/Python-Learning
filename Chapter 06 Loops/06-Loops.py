    LOOPS in Python

    Loops are used to repeat instructions.
    There are two types of loops:
        for loop
        while loop

    WHILE Loop =====> Its mainly used when we have needs of iterators and to update the variable value

            while condition:
                #some work
                #increament/decreament
    
    FOR Loop ======> Its used to traverse a datatype like list, string, tuples, dictionary

    for loops ======>
            for element in variableName:
                #some work
            
    for loop with else =====>                
            for element in variableName
                #some work
            else: 
                #work when loop ends
